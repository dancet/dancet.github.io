### Why does this site exist?

Have you ever felt like an imposter in your own skin? As if everyone is smarter than you?

Have you ever browsed your Twitter feed or the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> and been amazed at the number of people writing great blog posts about the tech industry, the latest programming language or framework and other really interesting and neat things?

How the _fuck_ do people get so much time to read, learn, build, code and be smart in general?

After much procrastination, I have decided that of course there is no shortcut that any of these people have taken, it's just a matter of getting on with it. 

This site is my version of getting on with it. 

I am going to try and blog semi-regularly when I think I have something worth saying. I'm not going to set the world on fire, but I am looking forward to having an outlet for different ideas I have bouncing around inside my head.
